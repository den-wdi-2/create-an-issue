# GitHub Issues Lab
## Creating an Issue for your Fellow Developers' Racer Games

Today you will be learning about GitHub issues. You will also be reviewing two of your peers' code and submitting two issues on each of their Racer Game repos.

Tonight you will solve these issues, as well as any the Instructors created, and polishing your Racer Game.

- If your Racer Game repo is a `fork`, which it probably is, in your own Racer Game repo please do the following:
  - Go to the Settings page
  -  Check the box next to Issues (this allows issues to be made on a forked repo)


- Head over to [GitHub's documentation on how to create an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) and read up!

## Exercise

#### Requirements
- Look across the aisle in the middle of the class.  The two people at the table on the other side will be the people whose code you will review and submit issues on.
- For each of these two developers' code do the following:

  1. Clone their repo (you do not need to `fork` it, because you will not need to `push` to it.)
  2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser and play the game for a few minutes. Think about
    - Are there any bugs?
    - Are there any relatively simple features that could be added to make the experience better? ( A scoreboard is simple enough. Playing someone over the internet would be too complex for now....)
  3. Spend at least 5 minutes looking at their code. Think about
    - Do you see any bad practices? (for example inline CSS or JS, generically named variables like `var a =`)
  4. Take a look at the Issues page on [Garnet's GitHub repo]( https://github.com/ga-dc/garnet/issues) for some examples of how to name issues.
  5. Use your new skills from GitHub's issue documentation above to submit 2 issues.

#### Deliverable

  The 2 issues you submit on your two fellow developers' repos ARE your deliverable.

## This Weekend's Assignment

### Make Your Racer Game Portfolio Worthy!

This weekend you will do the following things to make this game worthy of your Portfolio!

1. Refactor your game to use OOP if you haven't already done it.
2. Solve *at least two* of the issues on your repo, but as many as you reasonably can. Read up on [how to solve an issue and close it with a simple commit message](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/)
3. Put some extra work into the design of your game. Make it beautiful! Make it modern! Add some animations! Go nuts.
4. Host your site on GitHub Pages. It's easy! Check the docs [here](https://pages.github.com/)


Your result will be a beautiful, functional Browser game using the sophisticated object oriented pattern that employers usually want their developers to know! And to think, it's only the end of Week 2!

### Additional Resources

- Become an issue guru by reading GitHub's [Mastering Issues Documentation](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

### Self Evaluation

During the previous exercise, rate your progress on a scale of 1-5 (5 being the highest) for the following criteria:

- **Persistence:** Do you handle frustration well? Do you independently pursue understanding?
- **Organization:** Do you thoughtfully implement best coding patterns and practices?
- **Collaboration:** Do you make an effort solve problems and share your ideas with others?
- **Communication:** Do you clearly convey your thoughts to others in illustrative and clear ways?
- **Self-compassion:** Do you make productive use of turning failures into learning opportunities?
- **Resourcefulness:** Do make an effort to compare and contrast new ideas with ones you already know?
